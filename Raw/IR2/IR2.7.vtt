00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.280
Now let's bring translation into the picture.
Coordinate frame A, Coordinate frame B which

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.969
is translated and rotated with respect to
coordinate frame A and a point P. We can represent

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.410
the point P by a vector with respect to frame
B and that vector can be described in terms

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.059
of its components along the XB and YB axis.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:30.989
Now we can rotate that vector into a new frame,
coordinate frame V, and coordinate frame V

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.010
has axes which are parallel to coordinate
frame A. We've already talked about how to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.280
rotate a vector from one coordinate frame
to another using a rotation matrix. And as

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.710
a sanity check that we've written this expression
correctly, we noticed that these two Bs are

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.649
next to each other. That's a good thing.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.569
Now let's describe the origin of coordinate
frame V with respect to coordinate frame A

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:03.019
and we do that with a vector. That's a vector
from A to V. Now we're allowed to add vectors

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.650
so we can add this vector ATV to the vector
VP to obtain the vector that describes the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.510
point P with respect to coordinate frame A.
We can do that because these two vectors are

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.970
described with respect to coordinate frames
whose axes are parallel to one another. I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.470
can substitute one equation into the other
and write this. And again because these two

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.700
coordinate frames are parallel I can write
this.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.220
Let's expand the vectors and matrix in this
expression and write them in terms of their

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.230
elements. Now I can pull a little bit of a
trick and now write it like this. If you're

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.470
unsure about this step, expand out the matrix
and convince yourself that they are exactly the same.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.200
Now this expression has got a two-element
vector and a three-element vector over here.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.650
Let's make things a little bit more symmetric
and write it like this. What we've done now

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.720
is added some zeros and some ones to the bottom
row of the matrix. Previously we had a 2x2

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.659
rotation matrix. Now we see that that's embedded
into the top left corner of a 3x3 matrix.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.980
And our vectors which used to have 2 elements
now have three elements. We can write this

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.129
even more succinctly in this form. The notation,
the tilde, above the little p indicates that

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.650
it is a homogeneous vector. It has got three
elements not two, and we'll talk about that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.709
in just a moment. The point is described with
respect to coordinate frame A by a homogeneous

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.079
vector which we can obtain from the homogeneous
vector of the point with respect to coordinate

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.139
frame B multiplied by this matrix.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.819
The elements of the matrix include the rotation
matrix, which is the function of the orientation;

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.859
Theta, and the translation between the origin
of coordinate frame A and coordinate frame

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.249
B. We have the familiar representation of
a vector in a 2-dimensional plane, two numbers

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:07.439
A and B. The homogeneous vector has got three
elements in it. It's got A and B and an additional

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:15.040
element which is set to 1. This we refer to
as a homogeneous transformation. It is a 3x3

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.459
matrix. The homogeneous transformation matrix
T comprises a rotation matrix which is 2x2

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.989
and a translation vector which is a 2x1 matrix
padded out with a couple of zeros and a one.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.579
This matrix describes a relative pose. It
describes the pose B with respect to the pose

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.499
of A. All of that is encoded in this single
3x3 matrix. A mathematician would say that

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:46.079
homogeneous transformation belongs to the
special Euclidian group of dimension 2. Symbolically

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.419
we would say matrix T belongs to the set SE(2).

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:58.209
Finally it's time to start making these abstract
concepts real. Pose is just a matrix. Where

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.809
we had the symbol ksi before we can substitute
this 3x3 homogeneous transformation matrix.

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:11.129
When we talk about compounding or joining
two poses together using the O+ operator,

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.139
that is exactly the same as multiplying these
two homogeneous transformations. We use the

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.780
O- operator to indicate the negation of a
relative pose, and that is simply the inverse

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.449
of a homogeneous transformation matrix. I
mentioned earlier that the inverse of a rotation

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.550
matrix is equal to its transpose. That is
not the case for a homogeneous transformation

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.389
matrix. You need to perform a proper matrix
inverse: invert a 3x3 matrix.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.780
We introduced a dot operator which transforms
a vector from one coordinate frame to another.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:55.550
And that is simply the product of the homogeneous
transformation matrix and the vector represented

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.970
in homogeneous form. Remember that the homogeneous
vector is obtained from the original vector

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.550
P, the two vector and we augment or append
a one element to that to form a three element

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.979
vector.

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.289
Here we are in MATLAB and we're going to experiment
with these 2-dimensional homogeneous transformation

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.879
matrices. So what I’m going to do is introduce
a function called transl2 which creates a

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.860
homogeneous transformation representing a
pure translation, that is a translation of

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.919
1 in the x direction and 2 in the y direction.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.849
Previously we saw how to create a 2-dimensional
rotation matrix, for instance a rotation of

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:45.669
30 degrees is created like this. We see that
this rotation matrix is only 2x2 compared

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.840
to the 3x3 homogeneous transformation matrix.
So I can create a homogeneous transformation

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.490
matrix equivalent of this rotation by prefixing
with the letter T. This function returns a

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.000
3x3 homogeneous transformation matrix. We
can see the rotation matrix part up in the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.120
top left corner. We can see that the translation
part of this matrix is equal to zero. This

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.820
homogeneous transformation matrix represents
a pure rotation.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:31.420
Now we can multiply these two together. transl2, Multiply it by the rotation part - 30 degrees.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.100
And now what I have is a homogeneous transformation which represents a pose.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.790
It's got a rotational component and it's got a translational component.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.470
Now the toolbox has got a shorthand function to achieve this.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.539
I pass in the x and y translational
parts; the rotational part and the option

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.739
to say that that angle is specified in units
of degrees. We have exactly the same matrix here.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.840
Now let's plot this particular pose and see
what it looks like. And to do that I'm going

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:09.219
to create an axis in which to plot, and x
is going to vary from 0-5 and y is going to

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:16.129
vary from 0-5. I need to set the aspect ratio
so that everything looks reasonable, so I'm

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:24.039
going to set the axis so that the aspect ratio
is square. I'm going to put a hold on because

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.250
I'm going to plot a few poses. The first pose
I'm going to plot I'm going to put into workspace

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.919
variable T1 and it is the pose that I looked
at just a moment ago: 1 in the x direction,

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:40.680
2 in the y direction and the rotation of 30
degrees. There is a homogeneous transformation

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.669
matrix. Now I'm going to plot that.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:50.009
To plot that I use the function trplot2. The
2 suffix means that it's for 2-dimensional

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:57.039
poses. Pass in the pose represented by the
homogeneous transformation. I'm going to plot

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:03.960
it as a frame named 1, and I'm going to plot
it in the color blue. There are quite a few

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.539
options there. And there we see the pose plotted.
We can see that it does indeed have a translational

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:17.090
component; 1 in the x direction, 2 in the
y direction. And it is rotated with respect

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.719
to the world coordinate frame.

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:26.229
I can create another pose quite easily. I
can create a pose that has got an offset of

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:32.469
2 in the x direction. 1 in the y direction
and no rotation. That's what the homogeneous

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:37.469
transformation looks like. Now I'm going to
plot that. I'm going to use the function trplot2

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:42.649
again, pass in the homogeneous transformation
matrix, and I’m going to plot it as a frame

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:49.440
labeled 2. To be different I'm going to plot
it as a red colored frame, and here we see

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.950
the second pose. It's got no rotation. It
has got a translational component.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:03.600
Now I can compose 2 of these poses. I’m
going to say pose 3 is equal to pose 1 compounded

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.450
with pose 2. That's what the transformation
matrix looks like. I can plot that. I'm going

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:20.160
to plot that one, trplot2, pass in the matrix,
there's going to be a frame, called 3 and

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.000
I'm going to color that one green. So if
I compound those 2 poses I end up with the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.230
pose shown here as 3. The way we can think
about this is we moved from the world frame

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:38.700
2 from frame 1 which is rotated, and then
in frame 1 we then moved 2 in the x direction

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:45.320
and 1 in the y direction. But X and Y direction
are frame 1, not on the world frame, and that

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.160
gets us to the frame labeled as frame 3.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.740
I could compound the poses in the opposite
order. I'm going to create a new pose T4 and

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:05.420
it's going to be pose 2 compounded with pose
1. We can see that's what the homogeneous

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:12.110
transformation matrix looks like and it's
different to T3. I can plot this. I can pass

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:21.130
in T4. I can plot it as a frame labeled 4
and I'm going to plot it in the color cyan.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:31.260
Here we can see the frame 4 which has resulted
from compounding pose 2 with post 1. Now I'm

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.570
going to introduce a point into the plot.
I'm going to introduce a point at a coordinate

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:44.360
3, 2. I need to transpose that so that it
becomes a column vector. There it is. I can

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:53.040
plot that. Plot point P, and I'm going to
plot it as an asterisk. There we see it in

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.360
our figure. If I want to determine the coordinate
of the point with respect to frame 1 then

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:08.990
what I need to do is to use the inverse of
the relative pose 1, which is that, and multiply

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:14.910
it by the points coordinate in homogeneous
form. I'll take point P and I'm going to append

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:22.649
a 1 to it. What I have now is the homogeneous
coordinate of the asterisk with respect to

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.260
the coordinate frame 1.
