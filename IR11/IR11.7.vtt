00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
In the last lecture, we considered independent
joint control, which is an idealisation of

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.781
the real world. With independent joint control,
the motor torque has got two components. It

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:18.750
has a component due to the motor's inertia,
and it has a component due to the motor's

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.380
viscous friction. So, one is a function of
the motor inertia and the motor's acceleration,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.270
the motor's viscous friction and the motor's
angular velocity.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.410
Now, we're going to consider the more realistic
case of non-independent joint control and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.070
we've added the so-called rigid body dynamic
terms here. What this means is the torque

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.030
seen by the motor on joint J is going
to be influenced by the acceleration of all

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.280
of the joints, the velocity of all of the
joints, and gravity. Now, I've introduced

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.540
a bit of additional notation here. It's the
subscript j and what that means is the jth

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.720
row of the corresponding matrix. So, this
is the jth row of the matrix M, jth row of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.200
the matrix C or the jth element of the vector
G. For example, if I multiply the jth row

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.000
of the matrix M by the column vector, which
is the acceleration of all of the joints,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.210
the result will be a scalar. This is a scalar
expression because it's about the torque acting

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.229
on joint J.
You'll see that there are two terms here that

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.159
involve joint acceleration. So, what I'm going
to do is consider the vector Mj in two components.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.170
There is the component associated with joint
J and there's the component associated with

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.149
all of the other joints, which I've denoted
by M bar. I can do a little bit of rearrangement

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.729
now. What we have now is an expression for
the torque acting on joint J in terms of the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.579
motor's own inertia and the component of the
inertia matrix associated with this joint,

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.539
the viscous friction, and then, we have all
of the other terms at the end which are the

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.310
disturbance torque.
This term here is the inertia of a motor

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.659
which is driving joint J. This is a variable
inertia term that we pull out off the manipulator

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.600
inertia matrix. We have the motor joint friction,
which is a function just of the motor driving

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.780
the joint, and then we have this rather complex
disturbance term on the end, which is the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.060
acceleration of all the other joints, the
Coriolis and centripetal terms and the gravity

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.349
term. I can simplify it even further and we
now have a new inertia, I call that J prime,

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.290
which is a function of the configuration of
the robot. It's a function of Q. We have our

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.260
viscous friction and we have tau D which is
the disturbance torque lumped into a single

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.390
variable.
So, what are the issues that arise from this?

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.140
Well firstly, we have an issue because the
inertia experienced by the joint varies with

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.690
the configuration of the robot. In the last
lecture, we tuned our controller so that it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.750
had a nice response in terms of settling time
and overshoot, but the tuning was a function

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.610
of the particular values of inertia and viscous
friction. Now, what we're saying is that the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.330
inertia that the joint controller sees is
a function of the configuration. It depends

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.030
on all of the joint angles. So, that means
that the response of the control system will

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.620
depend on the robot's pose.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.110
The other big issue is the disturbance torque,
that's a torque that’s exerted on joint J due

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.709
to motion of all the other joints, acceleration
and velocity and also, due to gravity. This

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.760
may lead to undesirable motion of the joint.
It may lead to path following errors, for

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.340
example. So, what can we do about these issues?
Well, a really simple technique is really

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.670
widely used in robots is to introduce a gearbox.
Most robots have a reduction gearbox. So,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.950
the output shaft rotates a factor of G times
slower than the input shaft. G is the gear

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.909
ratio. The reason that this typically happens
is that electric motors are capable of running

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.900
very, very quickly, capable of very, very
high rotational velocity, but generally quite

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.079
low in torque. What a gearbox does is it allows
us to trade off some of this high angular

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.200
velocity for motor torque. Torque is actually
more useful than speed. We can see here the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.069
relationship between torque and velocity on
the output side of the gear box indicated

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.299
by the subscript l. L meaning the load side
and torque and velocity on the input side

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.060
denoted by the subscript m.
If we now address the expression that we had

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.600
from the previous slide and introduce the
gearbox, we see the expression now looks something

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.890
like this. We can see that the effect of this
variable inertia, the inertia that's a function

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.220
of Q, is now being reduced by a factor of
G squared. If I considered the case where I've got

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.850
a reduction gearbox, where G is equal to 50,
this is a reduction by 2500. It's a very,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.100
very significant reduction in this configuration
dependent inertia. It means that the motor’s

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.090
own inertia, this term here, will dominate.
The inertia will look more constant. We can

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.900
also see that our disturbance term has been
reduced by a factor of G. Again, if I have

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.790
a reduction ratio of 50, this term here is
50 times less significant than it would be

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.140
without a gearbox. So, a gearbox is useful
for many reasons and it's a really effective

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.220
way of reducing the effect of disturbance
torques and configuration dependent inertia.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.590
A more sophisticated technique to deal with
this is to compute this disturbance torque.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.610
If we have a dynamic model of our robot and
we know the position, velocity and acceleration

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.260
of all of the links, then we can compute this
disturbance term. So, the control that is

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.130
shown here is effectively a P, D controller.
This is the P term. This is the D term, and

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.840
this is the feedforward term, with the feedforward,
the disturbance that we can compute. Of course,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.590
this means that we need to know accurately
the dynamic parameters of our robot arm.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.060
The third approach that we can use is called
computed-torque control. It has some similarities

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.810
but also, some important differences to the
feedforward control expression. Here, we can

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.370
see a term which is effectively a proportional
controller. Here, we can see a term which

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.440
is effectively a derivative controller. They're
multiplied by the inertia matrix and here,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.480
we have the centripetal and Coriolis term
and the gravity term.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.050
What are the pros and cons of these different
techniques? A gearbox is cheap and straightforward.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.720
Often times, we use a gearbox in a robot anyway
so that we can use a cheaper low torque motor.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.640
Gearboxes do add cost and they add weight.
They do some inefficiency and they make noise.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.750
Computed-torque control has to be computed
every single sample. So, if our robot controller

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.360
is running, at say, a thousand Hertz, then
the expression that we had on the previous

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.830
slide needs to be computed at one thousand
Hertz. That involves the computation of those

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.870
matrices, the M, the C and the G matrix and
some matrix multiplication. So a lot of computation

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.930
needs to be done. Once upon a time, this was
really, really hard to do. In the early days

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.090
of robotics, when computers were really slow,
it was a very hard thing. So, all sorts of

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.300
approximations were introduced, but today
it's very, very easy to do that at a frequency

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.320
like one thousand Hertz.
The feedforward control can actually be computed

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.890
at a slow rate, and that reflects the reality
that the dynamic torques don't actually change

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.190
all that much from one sample time to the
next. So, the feedforward control signal can

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.360
be computed at perhaps fifty Hertz or a hundred
Hertz, while the main control is implemented

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.470
at something like one thousand Hertz. They
don't have to be computed at the same rate.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.290
For the computed-torque control and for the
feedforward control, there is a significant

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:35.660
challenge in knowing the actual values of
the dynamic parameters of each of the links.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.350
For each link, there are ten dynamic parameters
as we discussed earlier. So, for a six link

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:48.140
industrial robot, that's sixty dynamic parameters
need to be identified. You can do it experimentally

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.111
or you can perhaps do it from a CAD model
of the robot.
