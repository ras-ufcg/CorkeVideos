00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.490
Eu era uma criança in the 1960s. It was a time
of great technological progress and great

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.860
excitement about technologies. Perhaps the
biggest example at that time was man's space

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.160
travel. It was the time when the first astronauts
would go into space. When I grew up, it was

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.099
clear that I wanted to be an astronaut.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.649
The other image of technological progress
was robots and at this time, there were mostly

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.979
robots in fiction. On television, when I was
a child growing up, there were many of these.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:35.920
However, there were many earlier depictions
of robots in fiction, perhaps the first one

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.269
is the character Maria from the 1927 movie
Metropolis. The robot Gort from the 1951,

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.989
the original make of the movie “The Day
the Earth Stood Still”. Then perhaps, my

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.649
all time favourite robot Robby from the movie
Forbidden Planet in 1956 and he appeared in

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.739
a number of other follow-up movies. Without
doubt, the two most famous fictional robots

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.519
are these two from the original Star Wars
movie, which debuted in 1977, R2D2 and his

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.340
talkative friend C3PO.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.399
These two characters depict robots as being
benign. That is helpful to the people around

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.920
them and also as being incredibly intelligent,
able to hold conversations in human languages

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.930
and being able to perform complex engineering
tasks like hacking a Death star.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.700
This more recent movie Robot and Frank depicts
a very plausible future where an old person

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.130
is being assisted in their daily life by a
helper robot and this is a robot that is humanoid

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.649
in form, able to converse with the main character
Frank in natural language, guide him to eat

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.659
better and to change some of his bad habits.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.469
However, all robots that we see in fiction
are just that. They are fiction. So, the robot

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.670
from the Metropolis movie way back in 1927
was indeed a human being inside a metallic

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.509
suit.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.210
You think, well that is probably not surprising
that technology back in 1927 was really pretty

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.830
primitive but it hasn't actually changed much.
In the 1950s, Robby the robot was also a human

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.310
being inside a large metallic suit.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.200
So, it goes even in the original Star Wars
movies C3PO was the actor Anthony Daniels

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.380
inside a gold metallic suit. So, it also was
for R2D2 the actor Kenny Baker inside R2D2.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.750
Since the beginning of the Star Wars movie
franchise very many, many other movies have

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.080
come out and introduced us to particular robot
characters and some of their names are depicted

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.250
here as a function of time.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.820
In fact, you might be surprise how many robots
you think you know or recognize. I love this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.150
particular cartoon, by Richard Sergeant which
shows a wide range of fictional robots and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.890
it is an interesting exercise to go through
this and see how many robots you can recognize

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.730
in this scene. The solutions are available
on the web.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.630
In addition to all the portrayals of robots
in television and movies, there have also

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.350
been a large number of books, Science fiction
books which are based on the theme of robots

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.820
and interactions between robots and humanity,
both good interactions and bad interactions.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.430
The word robot itself is a Czech word and
it means something like worker or slave and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.700
it was coined in a 1920 play by the Czech
playwright, Karel Capek. His play was titled

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.340
Rossum's Universal Robot or RUR. The theme
of the play is that people create robots to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.490
relieve them of the drudgery of everyday physical
work. The robots eventually get to resent

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.800
their role in society as being the ones who
do all the work. They rise up, they rebel

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.230
and they kill the human beings. So, this is
a very recurrent theme in many many robot

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.280
movies being made to this very day. We can
think of it perhaps as a reinterpretation

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.080
of the story of Frankenstein from at least
a hundred years before this.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.360
I had the opportunity to be in Prague a few
years ago and I went and paid my respects

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.340
to Karel Capek, I went and visited his grave
and a photograph is shown here and I was delighted

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.229
to see it that somebody has left a small model
robot on his headstone. I wish I had thought

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.180
of doing that myself.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.580
Perhaps the author who has done the most to
popularize the idea of robots in fiction is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.180
Isaac Asimov, a very, very prolific American
writer of Science fiction. A key element of

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.620
almost all of Asimov's stories are his laws
of robotics. In robots in his stories, these

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.770
laws were imbedded in the positronic brain
of every robot. The robots were incapable

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.520
of violating any of these laws. If you look,
these laws at face value, they all make a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.240
lot of sense, though in most of Asimov's stories,
there was always some wrinkle or corner case

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.210
in the implementation of the laws, the way
the laws interacted with human beings or with

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.390
other robots.
